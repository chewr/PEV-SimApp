		## TODO update sim_end
		## TODO time series statistics

		## Fleet implementation:
		## for each vehicle, call the statistics method over the whole time range
		## Merge the results that each vehicle produces (mean of utilization, sum of emissions)

		## Vehicle implementation
		## given a time range:
		## create a set of 30-minute buckets
		## iterate over history
		## for each trip in history, apply to relevant buckets
		## utilization should be passengers or parcels * minutes of trip / bucket size
		## emissions should be total distance of any sort. For trips that span multiple buckets,
		## the distance should be prorated into each bucket

		## For getting wait times:
		## TODO: strategerize this one?
